Knowledge skills were always envisioned as a kind of specialty skill
where you may have knowledge of a lot of things, enough that it may be
silly to track them as individual skills and instead use a knowledge
base system of some kind.  A proper knolwedge base architecture should
have granularity and heirarchy, such that learning about a specific rock
contributes to understanding rocks in general, and vice versa, but
related knowledge contributes only a minor bonus to checks.
